## Overview

Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a widely-used shell and command language interpreter in Unix and Linux operating systems. Bash scripts are sequences of commands written in the Bash language and executed in a Bash environment.

This README provides a basic understanding of Bash scripting, covering key aspects such as script structure, syntax, variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and how to run a Bash script.

## Script Structure

A Bash script typically follows this structure:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands here
# ...

```

## Shebang

The `#!/bin/bash` line, known as the shebang, tells the system to use Bash to interpret the script.

## Comments

Comments in Bash start with `#` and are used to annotate the script with human-readable information. Comments are ignored during script execution.

## Variables

Variables in Bash are assigned using the syntax `variable_name=value`. Example:

```bash
greeting="Hello, World!"
echo $greeting
```

## Conditional Statements

- **If-else statement:**
  ```bash
  if [ condition ]; then
      # commands if condition is true
  else
      # commands if condition is false
  fi
  ```

- **Case statement:**
  ```bash
  case $variable in
      pattern1)
          # commands for pattern1
          ;;
      pattern2)
          # commands for pattern2
          ;;
      *)
          # default commands
          ;;
  esac
  ```

## Loops

- **For loop:**
  ```bash
  for i in {1..5}; do
      # commands
  done
  ```

- **While loop:**
  ```bash
  while [ condition ]; do
      # commands
  done
  ```

## Functions

Functions in Bash are defined and called using the following syntax:

```bash
function_name() {
    # function body
}

# Call the function
function_name
```

## Running a Bash Script

1. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x script_name.sh
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./script_name.sh
   ```
